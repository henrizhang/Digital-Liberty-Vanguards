TO-DO :  
[/] Main Driver file (set up to test) [1hr+]
[O] Printing the map: which is made up of cells: can be locked in unaccessible - how should be implement that
[O] Navigating through the map: showing player location - upon entering - there will be text indicating what is inside. 
[/] Cells contain items, bosses, monsters, mini games: for clues -- 
[X] Inventory : hold items : ArrayList<Object> : when and where should be output the inventory ? 
[/] Characters -- Players and Bosses : health points, damage, attacks :
[X] Mini Games -- slot machine, matching game [1 hr++] : so how should we get the game to run upon entering cell?
[/] Items: clues,notes,keys,weapons : does it automatically add to the inventory?  

Questions to address : 
-upon entering: should we use ASCII to show how the place may look like ? 
-will the map size be constant 
-will the map have the same items each time you run the game  
-address the null and outofbounds cases 
Last priorities: 
-should we do save game?
-What's the story line exactly? 
-add another minigame
*mostly work on this together simultaneously
